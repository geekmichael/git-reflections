    Use git and github

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

    Use git to create commit or version can easily in a logical way, rather than automatically create new version for every change. In addition, having versions manually can minimize version control log for better review.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git, SVN, CVS and others are good for software development project, particularly for managing multiple plain text files simultaneously. Google Docs and Dropbox are better for single rich text files and multi-media files editing.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

  Run the command 'git log --stat' to list all commits with change descriptions, and 'git diff commit-id-pre commit-id' to compare two versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

  Use the command 'git checkout' can help reverse changes in case incorrect changes made to files.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

  I will use Git to manage all of my project files, system configuration files, and others.

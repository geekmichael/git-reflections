Q1. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  For a better control code update in case local version be replaced by the remote repository.

Q2. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks -- create a repository clone on the GitHub server
  Clones -- create a copy of remote repository to local computer
  Branches -- Different versions of local repository
